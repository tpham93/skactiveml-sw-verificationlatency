# Stream-Based Active Learning for Sliding Windows Under the Influence of Verification Latency

This repository provides a [scikit-activeml](https://github.com/scikit-activeml/scikit-activeml) implementation for the strategies implemented in **"Stream-Based Active Learning for Sliding Windows Under the Influence of Verification Latency"**, which is submitted to the ECMLPKDD Special Issue of the Journal Machine Learning published by Springer and can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-021-06099-z).

The experiment framework used for the publication can be found [here](https://github.com/tpham93/al-for-sw-verification-latency). Note, that this does not use scikit-activeml.
